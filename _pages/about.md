I am a PhD candidate in environmental economics at [Paris-Saclay Applied Economics (PSAE)](https://eng-psae.versailles-saclay.hub.inrae.fr/) and [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/), under the supervision of [Basak Bayramoglu](https://sites.google.com/site/basakbayramoglu/home) and [Laurent Lamy](https://sites.google.com/site/laurentlamy78/vitae). My research focuses on the role of the agricultural and forestry sectors in international climate negotiations. I work with quantitative trade model and game-theory framework, but also econometric methods for impact evaluation and spatial econometrics.
