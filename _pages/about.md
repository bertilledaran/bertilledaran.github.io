I am a PhD candidate in environmental economics at [Paris-Saclay Applied Economics (PSAE)](https://eng-psae.versailles-saclay.hub.inrae.fr/) and [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/), under the supervision of [Basak Bayramoglu](https://sites.google.com/site/basakbayramoglu/home) and [Laurent Lamy](https://sites.google.com/site/laurentlamy78/vitae). My research links international climate negotiations to land and land use, and particularly agriculture, livestock, and forests. I am working with different quantitative and qualitative methodologies: quantitative trade model, game-theory framework, causal econometric evaluation, survey analysis, and NLP procedure.
